/*
 The intent of creating a "standalone" CoreData.swift is to pull out the Core Data boilerplate from AppDelegate.
 Why do we do this?  For a few reason:
 * Keep AppDelegate clean and remove any unnecessary functions out
 * Core Data stack deserves to be in its own class. AppDelegate will initialize the stack and then it can inject the Core Data to view controllers.
 * If you ever need to create multiple managedObjectContext, initializing the Core Data stack is easy without having to get reference from AppDelegate and treat the Core Data as global function.
